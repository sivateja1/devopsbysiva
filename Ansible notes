Here are example playbooks 

Step 1: Understand Ansible Basics

Step 2: Install Ansible

Step 3: Write Your First Playbook

hello_world.yml

---
- name: Hello World
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Print Hello World
      debug:
        msg: "Hello World"

Step 4: Run Your Playbook

ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> <playbook_file>

Example:

ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook.yml

Options:

- -i specifies the inventory file.
- --check runs the playbook in dry-run mode (no changes made).

_Run the hello_world.yml playbook from Step 3_

Step 5: Learn Ansible Modules

install_nginx.yml

---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

Step 6: Write Playbooks for Real-World Scenarios

deploy_web_app.yml

---
- name: Deploy Web App
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Clone Git Repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/user/myapp.git
        dest: /opt/myapp
    - name: Install Dependencies
      npm:
        path: /opt/myapp
    - name: Start App
      service:
        name: myapp
        state: started
        enabled: yes

Step 7: Learn Ansible Roles

roles/webserver/tasks/main.yml

---
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

- name: Start Nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes

deploy_web_app.yml

---
- name: Deploy Web App
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  roles:
    - webserver

Step 8: Use Ansible Galaxy

No playbook needed for this step

Step 9: Practice and Experiment

configure_network.yml

---
- name: Configure Network
  hosts: network_device
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Configure IP Address
      ios_config:
        lines:
          - "ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0"
        parents: "interface Ethernet0"
